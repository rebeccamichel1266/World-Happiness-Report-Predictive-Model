This project uses the World Happiness Report dataset to predict a countryâ€™s Happiness Score and explore which factors most influence well-being. Using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn, I built and compared machine learning models (such as Linear Regression and Random Forest) to identify patterns in the data. The results highlight how features like income, life expectancy, and social support contribute to happiness, showing how data science can be applied to real-world issues for social good.
